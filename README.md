# Recursive Methods Project

## Overview
This project, developed by Abenezer Bekele, explores the implementation and utilization of recursive methods in Java.

## Files
- `Driver.java`: This is the main driver program for the project.
- `RecursiveMethods.java`: This file contains the implementation of various recursive methods. Each method demonstrates a different aspect of recursion, such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, or string reversal. The methods in this file are used throughout the project to solve problems in an efficient and elegant manner.
- `Problem2.java`: This file contains the implementation of a specific problem using recursive methods.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the .java files in your preferred Java IDE.
